## Configuration

1. Create `.keychain.json` file inside directory of this code and use `example.keychain.json` as your guide.
2. Type in Terminal `npm i` and then `node .`
3. Web server should be on port `4352`

Its recommended to have this on computer (or something which can run nodejs) that is always on, like Raspberry Pi or a Server and have a forwarded port `4352` if you can't forward port, use `cloudflared` or `ngrok`. If you want to use `Replit` **DONT PASTE YOUR PASSWORD IN CLEAR TEXT,** use secrets tab and change `keychain` variable in `index.js` to replit env.

Some calendars may not be happy with http iCal. Ignore that, they should have a button to Continue.
